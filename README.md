## A description of the application

A multiplayer game on a website, that will generate party code (similar to JackBox).

The players will be given a random line of lyric, and then they have 13 seconds to guess which Taylor Swift song the lyric is from by selecting 1 of the 4 choices.

There will be a round of 13 lines of lyrics. The score also depends on how fast they answer.

At the end of the round, players see their ranking and score.

(If time allows, I will make the game to have other artist other than TS that the players could choose to play the same game)
